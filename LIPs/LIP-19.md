## Abstract

This proposal describes a bundle of LIPs that establish a governance system that uses polls to accept and reject LIPs.

## Specification

LIPs included in the bundle are:

- [LIP-15](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-15.md): Poll Based LIP Process
- [LIP-16](https://github.com/livepeer/LIPs/blob/master/LIPs/LIP-16.md): Staked Based Polling System

## Specification Rationale

LIP-15 and LIP-16 are bundled because LIP-15 requires LIP-16 to determine whether LIPs are accepted or rejected. The community can evaluate this parent LIP to determine whether to accept or reject LIP-15 and LIP-16 as a bundle.
